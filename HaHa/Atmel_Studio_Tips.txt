 *****some of this still needs to be formatted (like menu sequences)****

 1) SETTINGS
	(a) MORE INTELLISENSE HINTS
		<Explanation here>

        ------Smart, Insert Spaces

2) EXTENSIONS
	(a) GIT
	Atmel Studio has a git *connector* extension. This means
	you need to have GIT for Windows already installed. Then you configure AS
	with the location and then you can commit/pull/etc right from within AS.
	<Instructions here> **download the extension and then configure**
	**Download GIt and GIT extensions** **Or Toirtoise**

4) DEV PROCESSES
	(a) Task Lists in Atmel Studio
	Atmel Studio (as well as Visual Studio) includes a feature for 'Task Lists.'
	This is used in industry very often (and many times coupled with GIT style
	issue tracking with assignments) .
	
	The basic idea here is that by placing a special comment this 'Task' will be 
	added to a list that can be easily viewed and the code/file accessed with by 
	clicking the task. 
	This is the format:
		//TODO: explanation of what needs to be done.
	
	**we could double this with GIT tasks as well where we assign, but its good 
	at the USER level so that they can easily find things they need to do, or 
	make notes about some sort of 'bypass' they did for testing and need to undo 
	at a later time.
